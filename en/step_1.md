## Introduction

If you are tinkering with electronics, sooner or later you will need to power your projects with different DC voltage levels. We show you how to easily build your own variable power supply.

When starting to play around with electronics, many people power their prototypes directly from controller boards, such as Arduinos. However, as the prototypes become more complex (e.g. with the addition of servos or motors), they soon require more power than these controllers can safely deliver. At this point, you’re going to need a variable power supply that can provide different voltage levels. Of course you can buy such a power supply, but it’s a piece of cake to build one yourself.

A good starting point for building a variable power supply is a laptop power adapter. These adapters normally provide relatively high output voltage and ampage. So just rescue an old laptop adapter from gathering dust at home, and you’re ready to go. The adapter used in this project provides 19 VDC and almost 2 A, more than enough to power most of the prototypes you’ll ever work with.
